# RPS-Game

  Welcome to my first-ever 'big' project using C++: the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. It might not seem like much, but for me, it marks the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of programming in C++. Let this humble project be the first step on what I hope will be an amazing journey.

# Contribution Guidelines

  I believe in open collaboration and welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving this project. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. There are no strict guidelines or restrictions on how you can contribute â€“ you're free to use your creativity and expertise to enhance this project in any way you see fit. 

  This project is open to everyone, and I encourage you to make it your own. Whether you want to fix bugs, add features, improve documentation, or simply experiment with the code, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

## Introduction

  This project is a milestone of my journey into C++ programming. As I delve into the world of coding, I saw this as a perfect opportunity to put my skills to the test. While I admit that this implementation might not be flawless, I'm excited to share my progress and eagerly welcome feedback from the community.

# How to Play

This is a command-line interface (CLI) game, meaning you play it directly in your terminal or command prompt.

To play the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:

1. Copy the code from the repository and paste it into a new `.cpp` file on your local machine.
2. Compile the `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. You can do this by running a command like `g++ -o game game.cpp` in your terminal.
3. Run the compiled executable file. Depending on how you compiled it, you might need to execute a command like `./game` to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your selection. You can choose "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by typing the corresponding word or using shorthand versions such as "R", "P", or "S".
5. Press Enter to confirm your choice and see the result of the game.

Here are the valid inputs for each option:

- Rock: "Rock", "rock", "R", "r"
- Paper: "Paper", "paper", "P", "p"
- Scissors: "Scissors", "scissors", "S", "s"

That's it! Enjoy playing the game and see if you can outsmart your opponent!
